# 🤖 UNIFIED-IO: A Versatile AI Model

**UNIFIED-IO** is a groundbreaking AI model architecture designed to perform a wide range of tasks — from computer vision (object detection, depth estimation) to natural language processing (text generation, question answering) — all within a **single, unified framework**. The model achieves strong cross-domain performance by standardizing all inputs and outputs as token sequences.

Unlike task-specific models, UNIFIED-IO handles multiple modalities (text, image, sparse, dense) with one architecture. It uses a unified representation system where:
- Text is tokenized via SentencePiece.
- Images and dense outputs are encoded using VQ-GAN.
- Sparse data like bounding boxes use special positional tokens.

## 🛠️ Features

- Unified token-based architecture across NLP and Vision tasks  
- Trained jointly on 90+ datasets spanning 22 different tasks  
- No need for separate fine-tuning per task  
- Transformer backbone with adaptations for image and sparse data  
- Achieves top results on the GRIT benchmark  

## 🧪 Architecture & Training

- **Backbone:** Transformer (inspired by T5)  
- **Stages:** Pre-training + Massive Multi-task Training  
- **Benchmarks:** GRIT benchmark (64.3 avg accuracy on UNIFIED-IOXL)  
- **Task Coverage:** 8 high-level categories, 22 sub-tasks  
- **Input Types:** Text, RGB images, pixel-level labels, bounding boxes  

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Outperforms prior models across multiple benchmarks  
- Ablation studies reveal the value of multi-task training  
- Limitations include object detection recall in cluttered scenes  

## 📈 Future Development

- Better augmentation techniques  
- Expand multi-modal datasets  
- Optimize inference speed and efficiency
